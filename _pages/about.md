**I have just started my PhD at UCL as part of the [Foundational AI CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/foundational-ai-cdt/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd), supervised by [Professor Lampos](https://www.lampos.net/). I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Generative AI and their applications in healthcare. Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained a MEng in Engineering Science from the University of Oxford.**
